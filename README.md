# NOP
The NOP programming lanuage. This a self-deprecating programming language that is intended to be as simple as possible but no simpler. 

Design goals:
- As few keywords as possible.
- Powerful ability for user-land applications.
- Easy to learn and use.
- Managed memory.
- Strong type system.
- Objects.
- Compiled. (via LLVM)

Status:

The parser is tested well enough to allow development to move forward. The next step is to connect the AST boilerplate (generated from the parser) code to the actual parser to generate the abstract syntax tree.
